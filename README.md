# GitHub Enterprise Importer CLI

[![Actions Status: CI](https://github.com/github/octoshiftcli/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/github/octoshiftcli/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)


The [GitHub Enterprise Importer](https://docs.github.com/en/early-access/github/migrating-with-github-enterprise-importer) (GEI, formerly Octoshift) is a highly customizable API-first migration offering designed to help you move your enterprise to GitHub Enterprise Cloud. The GEI-CLI wraps the GEI APIs to simplify customizing your migration experience. 

> GEI is in a private preview for GitHub Enterprise Cloud. It needs to be enabled before using this CLI. Please reach out to [GitHub Sales](https://github.com/enterprise/contact) to enquire about getting into the private beta. 

This version of the GEI-CLI is informally maintained by GitHub. However, this is **not a supported GitHub product**. Customers leveraging these tools must understand that any support must come through a paid GitHub Expert Services engagement.

## Supported Scenarios
GEI-CLI is continuing to expand what it can support. However, it supports the following scenarios at present:

* Azure DevOps -> GitHub Enterprise Cloud migrations

Learn more about what exactly is migrated and any limitations in the [GEI documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/early-access/github/migrating-with-github-enterprise-importer/about-github-enterprise-importer). 

## Quick Start Videos
Check out the below videos for getting quickly getting started with the GEI-CLI.

## Usage

GEI-CLI is a cross-platform .NET Core console application.  Execute the executable without any parameters to learn about the options. General usage will use the `generate-script` option to create a script that can be used to migrate all repositories from an Azure DevOps org and re-wire Azure Boards and Azure Pipelines connections.

### Command line
```
octoshift
  Migrates Azure DevOps repos to GitHub
Usage:
  octoshift [options] [command]

Options:
  --version       Show version information
  -?, -h, --help  Show help and usage information

Commands:
  generate-script
  rewire-pipeline
  integrate-boards
  share-service-connection
  disable-ado-repo
  lock-ado-repo             Makes the ADO repo read-only for all users. It does this by adding Deny permissions for the Project Valid Users group on the repo.
  configure-auto-link
  create-team               Creates a GitHub team and optionally links it to an IdP group.
  add-team-to-repo
  migrate-repo
```

To generate a script, you'll need to set an `ADO_PAT` as an environment variable. Performing any of the commands that touch GitHub will need the `GH_PAT` environment variable.

### Running a Migration 

Covering running a migration from **Azure DevOps** to **GitHub.com**. 

#### Download and Configure the GH-GEI command-line Tool

Navigate to the `Releases` for this repository and grab the latest release for your local operating system.
![Releases](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29484535/145065021-35f37a00-1a25-42a4-804d-11fd9f8cc811.png)
Once you have downloaded the `Release`, you need to extract it to your local machine.
**Note** you will want to place the `octoshift` executable somewhere easy to reference or add to your path.
![Folder View](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29484535/145065026-a519a7f0-fc1d-46a1-a1a5-cd96743b1bd1.png)

* [Linux add folder to path](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/)
* [Powershell add folder to path](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/714877/setting-windows-powershell-environment-variables/714918)

Once you have pathed the tooling, you will need to set `2` environment variables. 

* One will be called `GH_PAT` and will be your **GitHub Personal Access Token**
* The other will be called `ADO_PAT` and will be your **Azure DevOps Access Token** 

The scope needed for each token will depend on what command(s) you want run. See the scenarios below to ensure you have properly scoped personal access tokens. It's recommended that you pick the scenario which fits the needs of everything you want to do as part of migrating. 

#### I just want to run some migrations and grant/revoke the migrator role
Create a GitHub and Azure DevOps personal access tokens with the scope defined in GEI's [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/early-access/github/migrating-with-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-to-github-enterprise-cloud-with-the-importer#step-2-assign-the-migration-permissions-role-and-ensure-the-migrator-has-the-expected-pat-scopes). This will allow you to run these commands:

* generate-script (--repos-only)
* migrate-repo
* grant/revoke-migrator-role
* create-team
* add-team-to-repo
* configure-autolink

#### I want to do the above and also lock & disable the repository being migrated from Azure DevOps
In order to use the following pre & post migration commands:

* lock-ado-repo
* disable-ado-repo
* generate script (without the --repos-only flag)

You will need to include these additional scopes for your Azure DevOps personal access token in addition to the ones listed in GEI's [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/early-access/github/migrating-with-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-to-github-enterprise-cloud-with-the-importer#step-2-assign-the-migration-permissions-role-and-ensure-the-migrator-has-the-expected-pat-scopes):

* `Service Connection (Read)`
* `Build (Read & execute)`
* `Security (Manage)`
* `Code (Read, write, and manage)`

#### I want to do the above and also re-connect Azure Pipelines & Boards to the newly migrated repository on GitHub
If you want to re-connect an Azure Pipline or Board to the migrated repo then you'll need your ADO personal access token to be `full access`.

At this point, you can now begin to run and test the import process.

#### Run the Migrations

Once you have configured the `octoshift`(*gh-gei*) command-line tool and `environment variables` for the person access tokens, you can run the command-line tool and see all available options.
![octoshift help](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29484535/145065029-ea8b3fcd-fcea-4f9b-ba7e-f9d3407e17fa.png)

The first step you will want to run is `generate-script` to help outline all commands to migrate an entire **Azure Project**
This command will generate a `octoshift.sh` file in the local folder. You will want to open it with an editor tool as it can be quite large. It's recommended that you include the `--repos-only` flag the first time. 
Tools like `Atom`, `VSCode`, or `NotePad++` are great ways to see the data.
As you can see from the data, it builds out the command-line options one after another to migrate all repositories, lock repositories, create teams, etc.

You can then use this as a guide to pick and choose which commands you would like to run.
