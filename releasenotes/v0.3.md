- 2x timestamped log files are generated on every run, timestamp.octoshift.log and timestamp.octoshift.verbose.log. A future release will include additional functionality to avoid the log file sprawl this may result in.
- All commands support --verbose flag, this flag only controls what is output to the console. The verbose log file will always be created
- Every API call will generate verbose output with the request and response contents
