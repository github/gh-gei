- Add `wait-for-migration` command. It waits for the provided migration and returns as soon as it is complete.
- Add `--wait` option to `migrate-repo` command. If set to `true` (default is `false`) it will synchronously wait for the migration to finish, otherwise it will just queue up a repo migration and return the `migration-id`.
- Support parallel migrations with `generate-script` for both `ado2gh` and `gh gei`. `generate-script` now by default generates a script to perform migrations in parallel. Adding `--sequential` flag will force migrations to perform in a sequential (one by one) fashion.
- Deprecate `--ssh` flag in `generate-script` and `migrate-repo` commands for both `ado2gh` and `gh gei`.
- Add powershell shebang command for execution of script on unix based systems.
- Add executable bit on generated scripts in unix based systems.
- Updates most commands to be idempotent. They will check if there is anything to do, and if not they will print a message to that effect and complete successfully. E.g. create-team will check if the team already exists and if so exit as success (compared to previously where it would crash). The following commands have been updated:
  - configure-autolink
  - create-team
