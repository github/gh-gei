- 6 months ago in [v0.10](https://github.com/github/gh-gei/releases/tag/v0.10), we deprecated the --ssh flag, making it silently do nothing. Now, we’ve removed the flag entirely, so the CLI will error if you try to specify it. If you have any scripts that include the --ssh flag, you must remove that flag or the script will break.
- fixed a bug where secrets were not getting scrubbed from the logs in some circumstances
- If `create-team` fails when linking an IdP group with an HTTP 400, we will retry
- If `create-team` fails when removing the initial team member, it will retry
- In v0.25 we started publishing `ado2gh` as an extension to the `gh` CLI. However, we didn't update `ado2gh generate-script` to use the new syntax in the generated migration script. Now it will, and you will need the `gh ado2gh` extension installed in order to run the generated migration script.
- Added `--ghes-api-url` as an optional arg to the `grant-migrator-role` and `revoke-migrator-role` commands for both `ado2gh` and `gei`.
- Added AWS support for archive uploads to `gei` using the `--aws-bucket-name`, `--aws-access-key` and `--aws-secret-key` arguments.
