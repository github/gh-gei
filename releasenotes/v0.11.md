- Updating commands to be idempotent. They will check if there is anything to do, and if not they will print a message to that effect and complete successfully. E.g. create-team will check if the team already exists and if so exit as success (compared to previously where it would crash). The following commands have been updated:
  - disable-ado-repo
- The change to automatically set the +x bit on the generated migration script has been rolled back (introduced in v0.10). We discovered a bug with this that caused `generate-script` to crash on MacOS. We're temporarily rolling this back to unblock customers while we investigate and fix the problem.
