- Added descriptions to all commands in the built-in CLI help
- add-team-to-repo now includes built-in help listing the valid values for the --role argument (octoshift add-team-to-repo --help), the CLI also validates the value of --role before attempting to run.
- integrate-boards command now expects a single call per repo (instead of single call per team project with a list of repos). This will enable splitting a single team project into multiple batches for migration purposes. If no Boards-GitHub connection exists it will create it, otherwise it will add the repo to the existing connection. It assumes either 0 or 1 boards connection exists per team project (multiple connections in a single team project has not been tested).
- migrate-repo now uses the GH_PAT for git push. The GH_PAT needs to have the repo scope in order for the git push to work.
