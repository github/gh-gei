- Create shared access signature (SAS) with read-only permissions - not read-write - when generating Azure Blob Storage URL
- Fixes bug where CLI would crash if the source was GHAE (while trying to parse the version)
- Add support for authenticating with AWS session tokens when using AWS S3 for archive upload in `gh gei` and `gh bbs2gh`. When specifying a session token, the AWS region must also be specified.
- Make parallel migrations scripts generated by `gh gei generate-script` and `gh ado2gh generate-script` more resilient by not halting the entire script if queuing a repo migration fails.
