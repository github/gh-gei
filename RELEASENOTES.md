- Remove `gh gei generate-archive`
- Update `gh gei migrate-repo` to allow for migrations from GHES instances. When `--ghes-api-url` is passed in, it requires an Azure Blob Storage connection string `--azure-storage-connection-string` and an optional flag to disable SSL verification `--no-ssl-verify`. This migration path generates migration archives on the source, uploads them to Azure Blob Storage using the connection string, then kicks off a GitHub Enterprise Importer migration using the uploaded migration archives.
- Modify `gh gei migrate-repo` to optionally accept two pre-generated archive urls to start a migration (not commonly used) and a target api url parameter
- Fixed a bug where `configure-autolink` command would fail if your ADO team project had a space in it
