- Removing the `--ssh` flag entirely. 6 months ago in [v0.10](https://github.com/github/gh-gei/releases/tag/v0.10) we deprecated the `--ssh` flag making it hidden, and do nothing other than warn the user that it's now obsolete. But we left in in as a hidden option so as not to break any customer scripts that used it. We're now removing it entirely. If you have any pre-existing scripts that use it you will have to remove the argument from your scripts or they will break.
