- Added validation to detect and return clear error messages when a URL is provided instead of a name for organization, repository, or enterprise arguments (e.g., `--github-org`, `--github-target-org`, `--source-repo`, `--github-target-enterprise`)
- Fixed an issue where repository existence checks would incorrectly retry on expected responses (200/404/301), causing unnecessary delays during migrations. The check now only retries on transient server errors (5xx status codes) while responding immediately to deterministic states.
- Added `--target-api-url` as an optional arg to the `add-team-to-repo` command
