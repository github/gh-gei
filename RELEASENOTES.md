- Add `wait-for-migration` command. By default it waits for all ongoing migrations to finish and reports the number of in progress and queued migrations. If an optional `migration-id` is provided, it will return as soon as that migration is complete.
- Add `--wait` option to `migrate-repo` command. If set to `true` (default is `false`) it will synchronously wait for the migration to finish, otherwise it will just queue up a repo migration and return the `migration-id`.
