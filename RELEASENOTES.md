- introduced a new command `gh gei migrate-secret-alerts` which migrates the state and resolution of secret scanning alerts. This is useful if you have existing secret scanning alerts which have been closed (e.g. revoked, false positive, etc). The state (closed) and resolution will be migrated over to the target repo with this command.
- make `gh gei migrate-org` visible in the help menu as this is now a published feature of GEI [see more](https://docs.github.com/en/early-access/enterprise-importer/migrating-organizations-with-github-enterprise-importer). We are now capable of moving an org with all their repositories, teams and certain cross repository references by running one command. ( Currently does not support GitHub Enterprise Server )
