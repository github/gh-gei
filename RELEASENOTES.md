- 6 months ago in [v0.10](https://github.com/github/gh-gei/releases/tag/v0.10), we deprecated the --ssh flag, making it silently do nothing. Now, weâ€™ve removed the flag entirely, so the CLI will error if you try to specify it. If you have any scripts that include the --ssh flag, you must remove that flag or the script will break.
- fixed a bug where secrets were not getting scrubbed from the logs in some circumstances
- If `create-team` fails when linking an IdP group with an HTTP 400, we will retry
- If `create-team` fails when removing the initial team member, it will retry
- In v0.25 we started publishing `ado2gh` as an extension to the `gh` CLI. However, we didn't update `ado2gh generate-script` to use the new syntax in the generated migration script. Now it will, and you will need the `gh ado2gh` extension installed in order to run the generated migration script.
- Added `--ghes-api-url` as an optional arg to the `grant-migrator-role` and `revoke-migrator-role` commands for both `ado2gh` and `gei`.
- Added `--bbs-shared-home` option to `migrate-repo` and `generate-script` commands for `bbs2gh`. This provides support for BBS servers with a non default directory path.
