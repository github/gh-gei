- Significant overhaul of how the `generate-script` command args work. Now by default it will generate a minimal script that only migrates the repos, and you will need to pass additional flags to script out additional automation (e.g. `--rewire-pipelines`, `--create-teams`, etc). The `--all` flag will include all the automation in the script (the same as the previous version with no flags).
- Updates most commands to be idempotent. They will check if there is anything to do, and if not they will print a message to that effect and complete successfully. E.g. create-team will check if the team already exists and if so exit as success (compared to previously where it would crash). The following commands have been updated:
  - migrate-repo
- A generated script using `ado2gh` or `gh gei` now include the CLI version that was used to generate it.
