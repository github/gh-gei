- Add a warning to help users who accidentally end up in the "running on the Bitbucket instance" flow in `bbs2gh migrate-repo`
- Fix version check so that a version later than the latest version published on GitHub isn't considered old
- Fix `download-logs` commands suggested by `bbs2gh migrate-repo` and `ado2gh migrate-repo` to use correct arguments
- Fix version number exposed in headers and `generate-script` scripts, removing the [revision component](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.version?view=net-7.0#remarks) so it matches the published version
