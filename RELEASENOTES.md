- Updates most commands to be idempotent. They will check if there is anything to do, and if not they will print a message to that effect and complete successfully. E.g. create-team will check if the team already exists and if so exit as success (compared to previously where it would crash). The following commands have been updated:
  - configure-autolink
  - create-team
  - disable-ado-repo
- Add ado-team-project parameter to `ado2gh generate-script` command
- Add ado-team-project parameter to `gh gei generate-script` command
