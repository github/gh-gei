- Fixed branch policy check for classic pipelines with prefixed repository names to use repository ID directly when available, preventing 404 errors during rewiring
- Skip branch policy checks for disabled repositories with a warning instead of attempting API calls that may fail
- Skip pipeline rewiring entirely for disabled repositories, exiting early with an appropriate warning message
- Fixed misleading success message that appeared even when pipeline rewiring was skipped for disabled repositories
- Fixed monitor timeout minutes to only display when --dry-run mode is enabled, reducing confusion during regular pipeline rewiring operations
- Check if pipeline is disabled before attempting to queue a test build, preventing 400 Bad Request errors and providing clear warning messages
