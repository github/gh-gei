- Added `--target-api-url` option to `gh ado2gh rewire-pipeline` command to support customers migrating to [GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/data-residency/about-github-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency)
- Updated CI workflow to enable publish step in pull request context for testing purposes, allowing validation of the publish process regardless of E2E test outcomes
