- Add `reclaim-mannequin` command. Reclaims a mannequin, by sending a mannequin attribution invitation to the target user. If the mannequin has been previously mapped (and accepted) it will refuse to do so unless the `--force` flag is set.
- Updates most commands to be idempotent. They will check if there is anything to do, and if not they will print a message to that effect and complete successfully. E.g. create-team will check if the team already exists and if so exit as success (compared to previously where it would crash). The following commands have been updated:
  - configure-autolink
  - create-team
  - disable-ado-repo
