- Improve error messages when the specified target organization or enterprise cannot be found
- Mask the value for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` parameters in log output
- Fix log output so we don't say we've finished upload to Azure Blob Storage when you're actually using Amazon S3
- Extend the validity of blob storage signed URLs so migration can still be successful even if there is a long queue of migrations
- Skip the upload to Azure/AWS blob storage when migrating from GHES 3.8+, as GHES will now handle putting the archives into blob storage
