- fixed a bug where `generate-script` would not properly handle Team Projects with spaces (or other invalid for github chars) in the name
- fixed bug where `inventory-report` would fail if your computer's datetime format settings were dd/mm/yyyy
- Support excluding releases when `--skip-releases` flag is provided in `gh gei migrate-repo` command for GHES migration path. Previously releases were excluded by default but now they are going to be included unless `--skip-releases` is provided.
