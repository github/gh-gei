- Add more options (i.e. `--rewire-pipelines`, `--create-teams`, etc.) to configure generate-script command's behaviour in ado2gh. `--all` was also added to opt in for all options.

E.g. create-team will check if the team already exists and if so exit as success (compared to previously where it would crash). The following commands have been updated:
  - migrate-repo
