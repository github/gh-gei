- Fixed a bug where ADO Team Projects or Organizations with special characters would fail to migrate
- When using `gh gei generate-script` the script will now validate that the necessary environment variables are set
- More robust retry logic, especially on http request timeouts
- Retry GHES archive generation process in `gh gei migrate-repo` in case of any failure 
- Changed the default behavior of `migrate-repo` and `migrate-org` to wait for the migration to finish (previously the default was to only queue it unless you passed `--wait`). If you want the previous default behavior of queuing it only (e.g. for parallel scripts that queue many migrations at once) there is a new `--queue-only` option. The `--wait` option still works but is now obsolete and will print a warning if used, and will be removed in a future version. `generate-script` commands have all been updated to generate scripts with the new options/defaults. Any already existing migration scripts that relied on the default (i.e. parallel) behavior, will continue to work but will now run sequentially instead of in parallel. They should be updated to pass in `--queue-only` to retain the previous parallel behavior (or re-generated with the updated `generate-script` command).
