- Mask the value for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` parameters in log output
- Fix log output so we don't say we've finished upload to Azure Blob Storage when you're actually using Amazon S3
- Skip the upload to Azure/AWS blob storage when migrating from GHES 3.8+, as GHES will now handle putting the archives into blob storage
