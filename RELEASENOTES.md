- Fixed a bug where ADO Team Projects or Organizations with special characters would fail to migrate
- When using `gh gei generate-script` the script will now validate that the necessary environment variables are set
- More robust retry logic, especially on http request timeouts
- Retry GHES archive generation process in `gh gei migrate-repo` in case of any failure
